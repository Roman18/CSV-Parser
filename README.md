# CSV Parser for C++

## CSV Parser for dealing with Comma-Separated Values files in your projects

### csv.hpp has initialization of all classes
### csvreader.cpp and csvwriter.cpp contain implementation of csv reader and writer respectively
### I have placed the tests in main.cpp, but you can write them anywhere. For proper testing you need a file named test.csv to read (it already exists in repo). The write test will also generate a file.csv.

```cmd
$ .\build.bat
$ .\target\csv.exe
```
